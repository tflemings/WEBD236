FizzBuzz
========

WEBD 236 Assignment 1

This program will solve the classic "FizzBuzz" problem posed by many programming interviews.
The idea is to examine all of the numbers between a specified start and stop value, inclusive.
If the number is divisable by three then print "Fizz".
If the number is divisable by five then print "Buzz".
If the number is divisable by both then print "FizzBuzz".
Otherwise print the number.

All invalid (non-integer) values or empty values will be converted to 1 for the start number
and 100 for the end number.
